## Description

This website is a Car Blog website designed to give the user better overview on car related blogs.
The websites blogs is connected to a REST Wordpress API with JS.
The front of the page showcases a welcome text and a picture of luxury car. Under this there is a carousel slider should showcase different car blogs, but since i couldn't get my JS to work properly at the time
I had to rush into the other sections of the project, will return to this and fix it.
Under the carousell you have Related Car Blogs section that give an overview of some of the carblogs, pressing one of them pushes you into the specified car blog that was clicked with a detailed
page on the blog. 
The website has a working NAV menu when the screen get's minimized. A list of blogs Page for better insight on everything there is blog wise, a contact page and an about page. In my opinion there are a few 
small fixes that i will implement on the site as it's not 100% complete.
